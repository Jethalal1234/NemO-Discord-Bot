## Self hosting

**We ask you to please not host your own instance of NemO.**  
Even though our license allows it, self-hosted instances of the bot have brought us a lot of headache in the past.  
If you're considering self-hosting, please [try the official instance of the bot first][botinvite].
If you have any concerns about the security of our instance, please contact us.  
We'd love to talk and answer any questions you have.
